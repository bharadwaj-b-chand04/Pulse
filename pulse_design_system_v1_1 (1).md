# Pulse Design System v1.1
**Companion to Pulse SRS v1.1 and Pulse UML Diagrams v1.0**
*Machine-readable reference. Every rule here is binding. Where this document and visual memory of "typical healthcare apps" disagree, this document wins. Where this document and the companion HTML preview disagree, this document wins — the HTML is a rendering of these tokens, not a second source of truth.*

**Changelog from v1.0:** replaced the type system (Fraunces → Faustina, Public Sans → Elms Sans) with rationale in §2.0; fixed five implementation-drift bugs (thread node size, display type scale, primary-button hover shadow, consent icon, provenance icon); added five previously-missing components (§5.9–§5.13); added §11 research grounding.

## 0. What Pulse is (context an LLM needs before generating anything)

Pulse is a unified lifelong Electronic Health Record platform. Four user classes: **Patient** (owns the record, low-to-mixed technical literacy), **Clinician** (time-pressured, needs speed and critical info first), **Provider Staff** (uploads records from hospitals/labs), **Administrator** (compliance, audit, restricted medical-content visibility). The product's emotional job is to make a lifetime of fragmented, anxiety-adjacent medical paperwork feel **continuous, calm, and legible** — not clinical-cold, not consumer-cute.

Design direction in one sentence: **a warm paper chart that happens to be software** — Notion/Linear-grade structural discipline, a soft grain texture instead of sterile flat white, a muted clinical-blue chrome with a dusty-rose human accent used sparingly, and a serif used only where the product needs to sound like a person, not a system.

---

## 1. Color tokens (exact hex — do not approximate or reinvent)

### 1.1 Neutrals — "Paper & Ink" (the base of every screen)
| Token | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `paper` | `#F6F4EF` | Page/app background. Always carries the grain texture (§7). Deliberately not `#FFFFFF` — a warm tint reads easier over long sessions than stark white (see §11). |
| `paper-raised` | `#FFFFFF` | Cards, modals, popovers — anything sitting "above" the page. |
| `paper-sunken` | `#EFEBE3` | Input fields, table row stripe, inset wells, code/mono blocks. |
| `ink-900` | `#211F1B` | Headings, primary text on paper-raised. |
| `ink-700` | `#4A453E` | Body text default. |
| `ink-500` | `#756F65` | Secondary/supporting text, captions, timestamps. |
| `ink-300` | `#A39C90` | Placeholder text, disabled labels. |
| `line` | `#E2DCD0` | Default border/divider. |
| `line-strong` | `#C9C1B2` | Table headers, emphasized dividers, input focus-adjacent borders. |

### 1.2 Primary — "Harbor" (clinical trust; the dominant chrome color)
| Token | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `harbor-900` | `#1F4552` | Text-on-tint, high-emphasis headings when a blue heading is needed. |
| `harbor-700` | `#2F5D68` | Primary buttons, links, active nav, primary icon stroke. **This is "the" brand color.** |
| `harbor-500` | `#5B8998` | Secondary icons, chart lines, mid-emphasis UI, the Continuity Thread line. |
| `harbor-200` | `#C6DEE2` | Borders on tinted elements, focus rings. |
| `harbor-100` | `#E7F1F2` | Selected-state backgrounds, subtle info backgrounds. |

### 1.3 Secondary — "Bloom" (human warmth; accent only, never dominant)
| Token | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `bloom-700` | `#A85468` | Hover/active state of secondary actions, emphasis text (rare). |
| `bloom-500` | `#C97B8B` | Secondary accent: illustration linework, empty-state graphics, patient-facing highlight. |
| `bloom-200` | `#F0D3D9` | Badge backgrounds (non-critical, e.g. "Patient" role chip). |
| `bloom-100` | `#FAECEE` | Subtle warm backgrounds (e.g. onboarding panels). |

**Hard cap: Bloom tones must never exceed ~10% of any single screen's colored surface area, and never appear as a primary button or as a status/semantic color.** It is seasoning, not the dish.

### 1.4 Semantic (status — always paired with an icon AND a text label, never color alone)
| State | Text | Fill/Icon | Background | Maps to (from UML) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Success / Allowed / Active | `sage-700` `#3F6E52` | `sage-500` `#5B8C6E` | `sage-100` `#E4EFE6` | `AuditLogEntry.outcome = ALLOWED`, `AccessPermission.status = ACTIVE`, `MedicalEntry` state `Active`/`Current` |
| Warning / Pending / Flagged | `ochre-700` `#8A5A17` | `ochre-500` `#C1873A` | `ochre-100` `#F5E8D3` | `DataQualityFlag`, `PendingReview`, `DuplicateReviewItem` state |
| Critical / Denied / Rejected | `brick-700` `#8C2E26` | `brick-500` `#C1443A` | `brick-100` `#F5DEDB` | `outcome = DENIED / FAILED_VALIDATION`, `Rejected` state, expired `ConsentRecord` |
| Neutral / Historical | `ink-500` `#756F65` | `ink-300` `#A39C90` | `paper-sunken` `#EFEBE3` | `Superseded`, `Merged`, `Hidden` states — deliberately *not* a semantic color, because these are not errors, they are normal lifecycle (§5.9) |

**Rule:** red-green color blindness affects ~8% of male users. Never let a semantic state be conveyed by hue alone — always pair with an icon shape (check / triangle / cross / clock) and a text label.

### 1.5 Absolute bans
- No gradients, anywhere, for any reason — not on buttons, heroes, backgrounds, or icons. Flat fills only.
- No pure black `#000000` and no pure white `#FFFFFF` used as a text/background *pair* (use `ink-900` on `paper-raised`, never `#000` on `#FFF`).
- No neon/saturated hues (no `#00C2FF`-style bright blue, no hot pink, no pure red `#FF0000`).
- No terracotta/burnt-orange/clay accent color (a well-known "AI-generated design" tell — avoid entirely).
- No glassmorphism, no background blur panels, no colored drop-shadows (e.g. a blue-tinted glow under a card). Shadows are always neutral, see §6.

## 2. Typography

### 2.0 Why these three fonts (decision record — do not silently swap fonts without updating this)

Three candidate fonts were evaluated against this brief (Elms Sans, Zen Kurenaido, Faustina) alongside the incumbent pair (Fraunces, Public Sans):

- **Zen Kurenaido — rejected.** Ships as a single weight (Regular only, no bold/medium/light), which makes it structurally unable to carry a type hierarchy on its own. It is also an explicitly handwritten/brush-derived Japanese-Latin design — expressive and informal, which undercuts the "trustworthy clinical record" register the product needs. Right font, wrong product.
- **Fraunces — retired.** Not wrong, but has become one of the most recognizable "AI-generated warm SaaS doc" serif defaults. Faustina delivers the same reassuring/editorial job with a lower-cliché footprint and a taller x-height (better small-size legibility).
- **Public Sans — retired.** A reasonable, purpose-built civic-service font, but Elms Sans is a better fit for this specific brief: a full 9-weight variable range (Thin–Black), an explicitly stated design goal of "quiet precision... subtle warmth in proportions" for design systems, and it is new enough (late-2025 release) to not yet read as a template default the way Inter/Public Sans increasingly do.
- **IBM Plex Mono — kept unchanged.** Still the correct purpose-built choice for machine-generated values; nothing in this review surfaced a reason to replace it.

**Result: Faustina (display) · Elms Sans (all UI) · IBM Plex Mono (data). Exactly three families — never substitute or add a fourth.**

### 2.1 Typeface roles
| Role | Family | Fallback stack | Where it's used |
|---|---|---|---|
| Display | **Faustina** (variable, weight axis 300–800) | `Faustina, Georgia, 'Iowan Old Style', serif` | Marketing headlines, section dividers, empty-state headlines, the wordmark. **Never body copy. Never buttons. Never table/data content.** |
| UI / Body | **Elms Sans** (variable, weight axis 100–900) | `'Elms Sans', -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif` | Everything else: nav, buttons, form labels, body text, headings inside the product (H3 and smaller), captions. |
| Data / Mono | **IBM Plex Mono** | `'IBM Plex Mono', ui-monospace, monospace` | IDs (`recordId`, `userId`), timestamps, ABHA numbers, audit log rows, version numbers, code-like structured values. |

**Rule of thumb:** if a human wrote the sentence to be *read*, it's Elms Sans (or Faustina if it's a headline meant to feel human/reassuring). If a machine generated the value, it's IBM Plex Mono.

### 2.2 Type scale (rem, 16px root)
| Token | Size / Line-height | Weight / Family | Tracking |
|---|---|---|---|
| `display` | 3.5rem / 1.05 | Faustina 600 | -0.01em |
| `h1` | 2.5rem / 1.1 | Faustina 600 | -0.01em |
| `h2` | 1.75rem / 1.2 | Faustina 600 | normal |
| `h3` | 1.25rem / 1.3 | Elms Sans 600 | normal |
| `h4` | 1rem / 1.4 | Elms Sans 600 | normal |
| `body-lg` | 1.125rem / 1.6 | Elms Sans 400 | normal |
| `body` | 1rem / 1.6 | Elms Sans 400 | normal |
| `body-sm` | 0.875rem / 1.55 | Elms Sans 400 | normal |
| `eyebrow` | 0.75rem / 1.4 | Elms Sans 700, UPPERCASE | 0.08em |
| `data` | 0.8125rem / 1.5 | IBM Plex Mono 400 | normal |

**Rule:** never go smaller than `body-sm` (0.875rem) for anything a patient reads. Never set Faustina below 1.25rem (it loses its character and starts looking like a body-copy mistake).

### 2.3 Loading (reference implementation)
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Faustina:wght@300..800&family=Elms+Sans:wght@100..900&family=IBM+Plex+Mono:wght@400;500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
If Elms Sans is unavailable via Google Fonts in your build pipeline, self-host via `@fontsource-variable/elms-sans` (OFL-licensed, npm-distributed) rather than substituting a different sans — see §2.0 for why the substitution matters.

---

## 3. Spacing, grid, radius

### 3.1 Spacing scale (base unit 4px — all margins/padding/gaps must be a multiple of this)
`4 · 8 · 12 · 16 · 20 · 24 · 32 · 40 · 48 · 64 · 96` (px)

### 3.2 Radius scale (exactly three values — never an arbitrary radius)
| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `radius-sm` | 8px | Inputs, small buttons, chips (non-pill) |
| `radius-md` | 12px | Cards, panels, modals |
| `radius-lg` | 20px | Hero panels, large illustration containers |
| `radius-pill` | 999px | Status badges, tab pills, avatar |

Never `0px` (too cold/broadsheet for this brief) and never above `20px` on rectangular containers (avoid bubbly/toy feeling).

---

## 4. Iconography

- **System:** Phosphor Icons, **Regular weight only**, rendered at 20px or 24px, stroke-equivalent ~1.5px, default color `ink-700`; `harbor-700` when active/selected; never filled/duotone/bold weight (mixing weights reads as inconsistent).
- **Custom marks required for four Pulse-specific concepts** (do not substitute a generic Phosphor icon for these):
  1. **Continuity** (the lifelong record itself) — a broken-then-rejoined line, echoing the "thread" motif.
  2. **Consent / Access grant** — an **open gate/latch**: two short horizontal bars with a gap between them (the "gate"), never a closed shackle-over-a-body shape. If your render looks like a padlock at any weight, it is wrong — redraw it. A padlock reads as "locked out"; Pulse is about the patient *granting* access, a different emotional register.
  3. **Provenance** (which provider a record came from) — a small circular **stamp/seal** mark (a ring with a short internal mark, like a wax-seal or postmark), never a teardrop/map-pin silhouette. If your render has a pointed bottom like a location pin, it is wrong — redraw it.
  4. **Non-clinical insight** (FR-6 summaries) — an outline chart mark with a small "i" or asterisk badge, never a stethoscope/heartbeat glyph (those imply diagnosis, which Pulse explicitly does not do — SRS §1).
- **Banned icon clichés:** red cross / plus-in-circle for anything except a literal "add" action, EKG heartbeat squiggle, generic stethoscope-in-circle as a catch-all "healthcare" icon, padlock for consent, map-pin for provenance, generic shield for "security" (use it only for the literal Administration/security-policy area, not sprinkled everywhere).

---

## 5. Components — spec summary

| Component | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Primary button** | `harbor-700` fill, `paper-raised` text, `radius-sm`, `body` weight 600, **`shadow-sm` on hover only** (resting state has no shadow). |
| **Secondary button** | `paper-raised` fill, 1px `line-strong` border, `ink-900` text. |
| **Destructive action** (e.g. revoke access) | Outline only by default (`brick-500` border + text on `paper-raised`), fills solid `brick-500` only on confirm step — never solid on first click, this is a healthcare app, no accidental one-click revocations. |
| **Status badge** | `radius-pill`, semantic bg + text pair from §1.4, always includes a small icon, 12px/`eyebrow`-style label. |
| **Card (record entry)** | `paper-raised`, `radius-md`, `shadow-sm`, 1px `line` border, provenance shown in `data` mono style bottom-right. |
| **Timeline / Continuity Thread** | See §5.8 for exact geometry. Never a solid flat rule — this is the signature element. |
| **Table (audit log, admin views)** | Header row `paper-sunken` bg + `line-strong` bottom border, `eyebrow` style header labels, body rows `data` mono for IDs/timestamps, `body-sm` for everything else, zebra striping optional at `paper-sunken` 50% only if row count > 8. |
| **Alert / inline banner** | Left 3px solid semantic-colored bar + semantic-100 background tint, never a full-bleed solid semantic color block (too alarming for a records app). |
| **Empty state** (§5.10) | Faustina `h2` headline, `bloom-500` line-art illustration, one primary action. |

### 5.8 The Continuity Thread — exact geometry (fixes v1.0 implementation drift)
The signature device: a hand-set dotted/dashed vertical line with small solid nodes at each event. Used anywhere chronology matters — patient timeline, audit log, access-history list, onboarding steps.
- **Line:** `harbor-500`, 1.5px dash width, 6px gap.
- **Node:** total rendered diameter **10px** = a 6px filled circle core (`harbor-700`, or the relevant semantic color for that node) + a 2px `paper-raised` ring around it for contrast against the paper background. (A bare 6px dot with no ring is nearly invisible on the warm paper tone — the ring is required, not decorative.)
- Do not reuse this motif decoratively outside chronological contexts; its meaning depends on scarcity.

### 5.9 Version / supersede history view (new — was missing in v1.0)
Directly implements the UML rule: *"Updates never overwrite. A correction creates a new version and links back to the entry it supersedes, preserving history."*
- Default view shows only the **current/active version** of each `MedicalEntry`, with a small `v{n}` mono tag and, if `version > 1`, a text link **"View earlier versions (n)"**.
- Expanding it reveals prior versions in `ink-500` (neutral, not semantic-colored — a superseded entry is not an error) each with its own timestamp, source, and a "superseded on {date}" caption.
- Superseded entries are visually **de-emphasized, never hidden or struck through** — strikethrough implies "wrong," but a superseded entry is historically accurate and legally must remain reconstructable (SRS §5.1, FR-2).

### 5.10 Duplicate review item (new — was missing in v1.0)
Implements `DuplicateReviewItem` from the UML (candidateA/candidateB/matchScore/state).
- Card shows the two candidate entries side by side (`paper-sunken` panels), the differing fields highlighted in `ochre-700`, and the `matchScore` as a plain-language label ("Likely duplicate" / "Possible duplicate") rather than a raw decimal — raw match-score decimals are an implementation detail, not something a provider or admin should have to interpret.
- Three actions, always in this order and never destructive-styled: **Merge** (secondary button), **Link as related, keep both** (secondary button), **Not a duplicate / Dismiss** (text button, no fill). None of these three is a `brick` destructive action — a wrong merge decision here is a data-integrity risk, not a delete, and should not visually imply irreversible danger.

### 5.11 Non-clinical insight labeling (new — was missing in v1.0; upgraded from a Do/Don't bullet to a hard component rule)
The UML stereotypes `SummaryInsight` as `«non clinical»`, and FR-6 requires the system to *"clearly label insights as informational and non-clinical."* This is a compliance requirement, not a style preference.
- Every chart, trend line, or summary card generated from `SummaryInsight` **must** carry a persistent, non-dismissible `eyebrow`-style tag reading **"Informational · Not a diagnosis"** in `ink-500` on `paper-sunken`, positioned at the top of the card, in the same visual position every time.
- This label is exempt from the "icon graveyard" concern — it is required even when it appears repetitive across a dashboard of multiple charts.

### 5.12 ABHA verification widget (new — was missing in v1.0)
Implements the onboarding step from UC-1 / SRS §3.1.1 ("Add/Verify ABHA ID step, using the ABDM Sandbox widget").
- Presented as a distinct step card, not a plain form field, since it is a third-party handoff (opens the ABDM Sandbox widget).
- States: `Not linked` (ink-500, neutral) → `Verifying` (ochre, pending) → `Verified` (sage, with the last-4-digits of the ABHA number shown in `data` mono, never the full number) → `Failed` (brick, with a retry action).
- Must display a small `harbor-100`-background note clarifying sandbox/synthetic-data status per SRS §2.7.2, e.g. "Sandbox environment — test identity, not linked to your real ABHA record." Omitting this note is a compliance-honesty issue, not just a copy nicety.

### 5.13 Critical-info panel (new — was missing in v1.0)
Implements the sequence diagram's requirement that critical highlights (allergies, chronic conditions, recent events) are fetched and rendered *before* the rest of the timeline, in the clinician view.
- Fixed panel, pinned to the top of the clinician record view, `brick-100` background **only if** an allergy is present (otherwise `paper-sunken`), never a full alert-red block.
- Content order is fixed: allergies first, then chronic conditions, then most recent event. Do not reorder based on data volume.
- This panel has no "collapse" affordance — collapsing critical clinical info by default is a safety anti-pattern in a time-pressured clinician workflow.

### 5.14 Role badges — all four roles (v1.0 only defined 2 of 4)
| Role | Badge style |
|---|---|
| Patient | `badge-bloom` (`bloom-200` bg / `bloom-700` text) |
| Clinician | `badge-harbor` (`harbor-100` bg / `harbor-900` text) |
| Provider Staff | `badge-ochre-neutral`: `ochre-100` bg / `ochre-700` text — reuses ochre not as a warning here but as "external actor," distinguished from the warning usage by always pairing with a building/institution icon, never a triangle |
| Administrator | `badge-ink`: `paper-sunken` bg / `ink-900` text, 1px `line-strong` border — deliberately the most muted badge, reflecting the restricted/background nature of admin access to medical content (SRS §2.1) |

### 5.15 Form field — error state (new — was missing in v1.0)
- Border becomes `brick-500` (1.5px), background stays `paper-sunken` (do not tint the field background red — too alarming for a records app, consistent with the alert-banner rule in §5).
- Error text appears **below** the field in `brick-700`, `body-sm`, prefixed with a small brick-colored triangle icon — never color alone (§1.4 rule applies to form validation too).
- Focus ring on an errored field is still `harbor-500` (focus state and error state are visually distinct signals; do not let the error red override the focus indicator).

---

## 6. Shadows (neutral only, never colored)
| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| `shadow-sm` | `0 1px 2px rgba(33,31,27,0.06)` |
| `shadow-md` | `0 4px 12px rgba(33,31,27,0.08)` |
| `shadow-lg` | `0 12px 32px rgba(33,31,27,0.10)` |

---

## 7. Grain / paper texture

- Applied **only** to large background fields (`paper` background), never on top of text, small components, icons, or inside data tables.
- Implementation: SVG `feTurbulence` (`baseFrequency` ~0.85, `numOctaves` 2) as a fixed, non-scrolling overlay, `opacity: 0.035–0.05`, `mix-blend-mode: multiply`.
- Purpose: softens the "sterile SaaS dashboard" feeling without resorting to a gradient or an illustration. It should be felt, not seen — if a reviewer notices "there's a texture," dial opacity down.

---

## 8. Accessibility floor (non-negotiable, this is a healthcare product)

- Body text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 against its background at all times (`ink-700` on `paper`/`paper-raised` clears this comfortably; verify any new pairing). Aim for AAA (7:1) where feasible, matching the aspiration stated by NHS Digital's own service manual (see §11).
- Large text/icons (18px+/bold 14px+) ≥ 3:1.
- Every semantic state = color **+** icon **+** text label, never color alone.
- Visible focus ring on every interactive element: 2px `harbor-500` outline, 2px offset — never remove `:focus-visible` styling, including on error-state fields (§5.15).
- Minimum tap target 44×44px on any touch surface (patient/clinician mobile web).
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: the Continuity Thread may fade in but must not animate/pulse continuously.
- Prefer lists and short paragraphs over dense prose blocks for patient-facing medical content — patients read this while anxious or distracted; do not require them to parse a paragraph to find one fact.

---

## 9. Do / Don't checklist (run this before shipping any screen)

**Do**
- Lead every screen's chrome with `harbor-700`/`harbor-500`; treat Bloom as a spice.
- Use Faustina only where the product should sound like a reassuring person (empty states, onboarding, section headers on marketing/about surfaces).
- Keep the grain texture on background fields only, at low opacity.
- Show data provenance (`sourceProviderId`, `isMock` where relevant) in mono type near any imported record, per SRS §6.3's honesty-about-sandbox-data principle.
- Pair every status color with an icon and a label.
- Use the dotted Continuity Thread for chronology, and only for chronology, with the exact 10px node geometry in §5.8.
- Label every insight/chart "Informational · Not a diagnosis" per §5.11 — this is a compliance requirement, not a style option.
- Show superseded record versions de-emphasized but never hidden or struck through (§5.9).

**Don't**
- Don't add a gradient, blur panel, or colored glow "to make it pop."
- Don't use Inter, Roboto, Arial, Public Sans, or system-ui as the UI font — Elms Sans is the contract (§2.0).
- Don't use Fraunces anywhere — Faustina replaced it system-wide (§2.0).
- Don't put Faustina on a button, a table, or a form label.
- Don't let Bloom pink become a second primary color or a status color.
- Don't use a padlock for consent (§4.2) or a map-pin for provenance (§4.3) — both are specified, redraw if your output drifts toward either.
- Don't fill a destructive action solid on first interaction — require a confirm step.
- Don't use pure `#000`/`#FFF` as a text/background pair, or any neon/saturated hue.
- Don't apply the grain texture to text, icons, tables, or small components.
- Don't tint an error-state field's background red — border + icon + text only (§5.15).
- Don't collapse the clinician critical-info panel by default (§5.13) — it is a safety pattern, not a UI convenience.

## 11. Research grounding (what this system was checked against)

- **NHS Digital Service Manual** (service-manual.nhs.uk): uses a tinted grey background rather than pure white for body content specifically because full white is harder to read for some users (the manual cites the British Dyslexia Association's style-guide recommendation of dark text on a light-but-not-white background) — this directly corroborates Pulse's `paper` (`#F6F4EF`) over-white decision rather than it being an aesthetic-only choice. NHS also enforces WCAG 2.2 AA as a floor with AAA as an explicit aspiration, and repeats the "do not rely on color or position alone" rule across its accessibility guidance — both are now stated as hard rules in §1.4 and §8 above rather than implied.
- **ABDM (Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission) Sandbox conventions**: informed §5.12's ABHA widget spec directly from the SRS's own description of the M1-scoped sandbox flow — the "synthetic test identity, not production" disclosure requirement comes from SRS §2.7.2, not invented.
- This is a design-system-level check, not a full competitive audit. If you are extending this system further, the NHS service manual's component library (`service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components`) is the most directly comparable public reference for a patient-facing health record product and is worth a deeper pass before adding net-new patterns (e.g. search, filters, forms) not already specified here.

---

*End of spec. If extending this system (new component, new screen), derive every value from the tokens above — do not introduce a new hex, font, or radius without adding it here first.*
